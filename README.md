## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a multi-threaded Java server-client architecture using socket programming. It consists of two main components: a multi-threaded server and a client. The server is capable of handling multiple client connections concurrently using threads, and the client sends requests to the server and receives responses.
---

## Server Component

The server component is responsible for listening to incoming client connections and handling each client request. Upon receiving a connection request, the server creates a new thread to handle communication with that client. This allows the server to serve multiple clients simultaneously without blocking.
---

## Client Component

The client component initiates a connection to the server and sends a predefined message. It then waits for the server's response and prints it to the console. This interaction simulates a basic client-server communication.
---

## Multi-Threading

Both the server and client utilize multi-threading to achieve concurrency. In the server, each client connection is managed by a separate thread, allowing the server to handle multiple clients concurrently. Similarly, the client creates multiple threads to simulate multiple client connections to the server.

## Features

Server: Listens for incoming connections on a specified port and responds to client requests.
Client: Establishes a connection to the server, sends a message, and displays the server's response.
Multi-Threading: Enables concurrent handling of multiple client connections on the server-side.
Socket Programming: Demonstrates basic socket communication between the server and client using Java's Socket API.

## Usage

This project serves as a foundational example for implementing server-client communication in Java. Developers can utilize and extend this codebase to build more complex networked applications, such as chat servers, distributed systems, or online games.
